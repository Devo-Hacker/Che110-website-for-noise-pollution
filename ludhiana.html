        <p>Ludhiana, a major industrial city in Punjab, India, faces significant noise pollution due to various factors. Here are the main reasons contributing to noise pollution in Ludhiana:
<br>
<br>
            Industrial Sources:
<br>
<br>            
            1. Textile mills: Ludhiana is known for its textile industry, generating noise from machinery.
            <br>
            2. Manufacturing units: Various industries, such as steel, automotive, and food processing.
            <br>
            3. Foundries and engineering units: Noise from metalworking, forging, and machining.
            <br>
            <br>
            Vehicular Sources:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. Increasing vehicle population: Growing number of trucks, buses, cars, and two-wheelers.
            <br>
            2. Traffic congestion: Heavy traffic, especially during peak hours.
            <br>
            3. Auto-rickshaws and two-wheelers: High-pitched horns and revving engines.
            <br>
            Commercial and Social Sources:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. Market areas: Busy markets, shopping centers, and loudspeakers.
            <br>
            2. Festivals and celebrations: Loudspeakers, firecrackers, and processions.
            <br>
            3. Public address systems: Loud music from public events, weddings, and announcements.
            <br>
            4. Construction activities: Building construction, road repair, and urban development.
            <br>
            <br>
            Agricultural and Domestic Sources:
            <br>
            <br>
            1. Farm machinery: Tractors, harvesters, and other agricultural equipment.
            <br>
            2. Generators and pumps: Diesel generators and agricultural pumps.
            <br>
            3. Domestic noise: Loud music, televisions, and household appliances.

            <h1 class="high"><u>Urban Region</u></h1>
            <p>Urban Areas in Ludhiana
                <br>
                <br>
                Sources of Noise Pollution: Heavy industrial activities (textile, manufacturing), busy roadways, commercial zones, and construction sites.
                <br>
                Typical Noise Levels: Noise levels in Ludhiana's urban areas tend to be high, often between 75 to 95 decibels (dB), especially near industrial or congested areas. Major intersections or heavy traffic zones can occasionally exceed 100 dB during peak hours.
                <br>
                Impacts:
                <br> Sustained exposure to high noise levels in urban areas can lead to hearing impairment, stress, cardiovascular issues, and disturbed sleep patterns.</p>
                    <h1 class="low"><u>Rural Regions</u></h1>
                    <p>Rural Areas around Ludhiana
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Sources of Noise Pollution: Primarily agricultural machinery (tractors, harvesters), occasional traffic, and seasonal gatherings.
                        <br>
                        Typical Noise Levels: Rural noise levels are generally between 45 to 65 dB, with peak levels around 70 dB during harvest seasons or rural events. These levels are lower compared to urban areas and are typically concentrated around agricultural activities.
                        <br>
                        Impacts: 
                        <br>Rural noise levels are lower and typically cause less disruption to daily life and health compared to urban levels.</p>
