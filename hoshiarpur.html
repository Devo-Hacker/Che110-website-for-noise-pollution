        <p>Hoshiarpur, a city in Punjab, India, faces noise pollution due to various factors. Here are some main reasons contributing to noise pollution in Hoshiarpur:
<br>
            1. Vehicular Traffic: The increasing number of vehicles on the road, including trucks, buses, cars, and two-wheelers, contributes significantly to noise pollution. 
<br>
<br>
            2. Construction and Infrastructure Development: Building activities, road construction, and urban development projects generate substantial noise.
<br>
<br>
            3. Industrial Activities: Hoshiarpur has various industries, such as textile mills, steel fabrication units, and food processing plants, which produce noise.
<br>
<br>
            4. Agricultural Activities: Farm machinery, such as tractors and harvesters, contribute to noise pollution.
<br>
<br>
            5. Festivals and Celebrations: Loudspeakers and firecrackers during festivals and celebrations add to the noise.
<br>
<br>
            6. Market and Commercial Areas: Busy markets, shopping centers, and commercial areas with loudspeakers, announcements, and vehicular movement generate noise.
<br>
<br>
            7. Rail and Air Traffic: Proximity to railway lines and airports contributes to noise pollution.
<br>
<br>
            8. Loud Music and Public Address Systems: Loud music from public events, weddings, and public address systems contribute to noise pollution.
<br>
<br>
            9. Generators and Pumps: Diesel generators and agricultural pumps create noise, especially during power outages.
<br>
<br>
            10. Lack of Enforcement of Noise Regulations: Inadequate enforcement of noise pollution laws and regulations exacerbates the issue.
