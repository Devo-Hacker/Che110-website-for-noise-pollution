            <h2>Understanding Noise Pollution</h2>
            <p>Noise pollution, an excess of unwanted sounds, can harm human health and disrupt ecosystems. It is a global issue, affecting both urban and rural environments. Here, we explore precautionary measures that can be applied at both global and neighborhood levels to mitigate noise pollution's impact.</p>

            <h2>Global Precautions for Noise Pollution</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Regulation of Industrial Noise</strong> – Governments can set strict noise limits for factories and industries to minimize impact on communities and wildlife.</li>
                <li><strong>Transportation Policies</strong> – Encouraging the use of quieter, electric vehicles and building sound barriers along major highways can reduce traffic noise on a large scale.</li>
                <li><strong>Promoting Quiet Areas</strong> – Designating "quiet zones" in cities and parks protects natural soundscapes and reduces noise in high-traffic areas.</li>
                <li><strong>International Standards</strong> – Global organizations can establish and enforce noise standards, especially in densely populated regions.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Neighborhood-Level Precautions for Noise Pollution</h2>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Soundproofing Buildings</strong> – Insulating walls and installing double-glazed windows can help keep out external noise and maintain quieter indoor spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>Enforcing Noise Curfews</strong> – Local communities can set curfew hours to limit loud activities, especially in residential areas during nighttime.</li>
                <li><strong>Tree Planting Initiatives</strong> – Trees and shrubs around homes and streets can absorb sound and act as natural barriers against noise.</li>
                <li><strong>Encouraging Quiet Neighborhood Activities</strong> – Reducing lawnmower usage and switching to electric-powered garden tools can help reduce noise in communities.</li>
