            <h1 class="high"><u>Urban Region</u></h1>
            <p>Urban Areas in Jalandhar
                <br>
                <br>
                Sources of Noise Pollution: Major roads, commercial areas, markets, factories, and construction sites.
                <br>
                Typical Noise Levels: In urban areas, the noise levels often range from 70 to 90 decibels (dB). Near busy intersections or construction zones, it can go even higher, sometimes surpassing 100 dB during peak hours.
                <br>
                Impacts: Prolonged exposure to these levels can cause health issues such as stress, hearing impairment, and sleep disturbances.</p>

                    <br>
                    <br>
Sources of Noise Pollution: 
<br>
Farming machinery (tractors, threshers), occasional road traffic, and village gatherings or events.
<br>
Typical Noise Levels: Rural areas generally have lower noise levels, averaging around 40 to 60 dB. At peak times, such as during harvest or festivals, it might briefly rise to 70 dB but usually does not sustain at high levels.
<br>
Impacts: Noise pollution in rural areas is generally less intense, with fewer adverse health impacts.</p>
